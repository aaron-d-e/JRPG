I wanted to create a game without the abstraction of a modern game engine (i.e. Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.) where I create everything from the ground up, only utilizing the SDL2 library. SDL3 has recently been released, but I am more comfortable with the established SDL2 library so will be sticking to that for this project. The current roadmap for features include an animation and sound engine, turn-based combat with enemy AI, as well as fun and engaging lore. Most importantly, this project offers experience in designing scalable systems at an industry appropriate level.
